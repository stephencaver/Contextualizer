# Contextualizer

Contextualizer is a CSS snippet that displays a widget on the page to indicate what media query context is currently active. I built this so I wouldn't have to constantly check the width of the browser viewport in order to know what Media Query I needed to use. Just include this code as part of your css (I recommend you keep it as a separate stylesheet apart from your core stylesheet) and customize the breakpoints to suit your needs.
